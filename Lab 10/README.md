## Lab 10 - Blockchain

## Steps for Comparing Hash values 
1) Run the following two commands and compare the output.

          $ cd ~/iot/lesson10
          
          $ python hash_value.py
            
The following two outputs are as follows, 

      Output 1
      
          The hash for 1 is: 1
          
          The hash for 1.0 is: 1
          
          The hash for 3.14 is: 322818021289917443
          
          The hash for Python is: 9012037900203850788
          
          The hash for a tuple of vowels is: 1656869808690947643
          
          The hash for an object of person is: 7909072654561468049


      Output 2

          The hash for 1 is: 1
          
          The hash for 1.0 is: 1
          
          The hash for 3.14 is: 322818021289917443
          
          The hash for Python is: 6711810364895373297
          
          The hash for a tuple of vowels is: -6921545617625019888
          
          The hash for an object of person is: 5026911483776632655
          
## Steps for running snakecoin.py
1) Direct to the file 

          $ cd ~/iot/lesson10
          
2) If you would like to view the file use the following command
          
          $ cat snakecoin.py
         
3) Run the code using the following  
        
          $ python3 snakecoin.py

The output is as follows,
