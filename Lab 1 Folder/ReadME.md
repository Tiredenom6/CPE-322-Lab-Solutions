The lab consisted of creating a directory file and loading coded programs into it. Following this I ran the code through Msys2.
Notes: 
  1) If using Msys2 terminal, you must change the application properties target to include usage of the full path.
          1) open Msys terminal
          2) Go to the file location and right click
          3) click view properties 
          4) change the target to " C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd -msys -use-full-path  " 
          5) (do not include the parentheses) 
 
 2) To change the file path, go to environment variables - advanced and then click on path under system variables. 
 3) Add the Downloaded files to your path. 
 4) you can copy the cloned repository form the lab into your Msys home file location manually if you have trouble with the following command 
                                     cp ~/dsd/ghdl/*vhdl .
                                     
                                  
                                  
                                  
                    To see the products of the assignemnt, please see the PNG files, Photos will not regsiter with commands.
