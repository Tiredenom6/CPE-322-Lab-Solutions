## Lab 2 - Command Lines
To test these command Lines use a terminal such as Windows Terminal, Gitbash, or Msys2
## $ hostname
The command hostname will print the systems DNS name. When called without arguments the command will print out the current system name. For instance my host name is DESKTOP-PL9I9BC
## $ env
The env command allows you to display your current environment or run a specified command in a changed environment. If no flags or parameters are specified, the env command displays your current environment, showing one Name=Value pair per line.
## $ ps
The ps command allows you to check the status of active processes on a system, as well as display technical information about the processes
## $ pwd
The pwd command allows you to write the standard output of the full path anme fo your current directory. These directories are all seperated by a slash moving left to write for directory (folder) hierarchy. 
## $ git clone https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git
The git clone command uses the gitbash command clone to copy a repository online to your computer. In this instance it copies Kevin W lu's github repository iot from the link https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git . This is very useful for organizing projects. 
## $ cd iot
The terminal command cd (curretn directory) tells you which folder the terminal path is set to. To modify this add an argument after cd as follows " cd filename ". The file for filename must be in your current directory or folder. This can be used to navigate to diffent directories. In this instance the terminal will make iot the current directory. 
## $ ls
The ls terminal command allows you to view the files and folder in your current directory. ls stands for list. 
## $ df
The df terminal command allows you to displays the information of your computer. The device name, total blocks, total disk space, used disk space, available disk space, and mount points on a file system.
## $ mkdir demo
The mkdir demo allows you to make a new directory (folder) with the name of the argument you pass in. In this instance the folder is called demo. This is useful for creating folders in the terminal.
## $ cd demo
This terminal command builds on the previous commands. Because when you make a directory using mkdir, the directory is made in your current path. You do not need to branch to the folder its in because you are already in it. " cd demo " allows you to enter into demo. 
## $ nano file

## $ cat file
## $ cp file file1
## $ mv file file2
## $ rm file2
## $ clear
## $ man uname
## $ uname -a
## $ ifconfig
## $ ping localhost
## $ netstat
